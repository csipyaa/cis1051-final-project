# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Email Verification

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A ssignup and login webpage that allows users to create accounts with specific password restrictions and requires a one-time verification code sent to either email or SMS. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
This project will involve creating a user login system with front end webpage. When creating an account, users will be required to create a password that would have to meet certain criterias, length, special characters, at least 1 capalitzaiton and at least 1 number. After registration, users will be able to login after they are able to verify their account through a one-time verification code sent to either email or SMS. This project will be executed using different languages. I plan to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front-end webpage followed by Py Flask for the backend framework to integrate a 1 time verification code to an email. 

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A functional webpage that allows user to create an account and login with password valdiation. 
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A functional login system with password valdiation as well as integrate a 1-time code sent to users email for verification
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A fully functional and aesthetically pleasing webpage with login system with password valdiation, including a password strength meter(visual representation (color: red , yellow , green)) to determine if your password is weak, medium or strong. This project will also include option for both email and SMS verification. The project will also store the user's information in a secure database.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
New skills I will need to acquire will involve learning basic frontend structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript followed by buidling the backend server using py flask.  Topics I will need to research on will understanding how to implement a strong password validation as well as integrating APIs for the verification code.
