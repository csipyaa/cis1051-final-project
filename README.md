### Back-end:
* Account creation, verification and login process will be created using Google Firebase.
* A one-time verification code will be sent to an email address upon account creation.

## Technology Stack
* Frontend: HTML, CSS
* Backend: Javascript
* Verification Integration: Email to send one-time verification code Using Google Firebase

#Notes
This project was an incredibly enjoyable and educational experience. I had the opportunity to dive into Firebase and explore its extensive libraries, which was both challenging and rewarding. I came into this project with some prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however the process of building a website allowed me to refine and deepen my skill with these languages.
